# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Have you ever caught yourself walking down the street, eyeing someone else’s dog, and thinking to yourself “wow that is such a cool dog, I WISH I could get one just like that but I don’t even know what breed it is or where to get one”? Well despair no longer, Kaynyne<sup>TM</sup> is the solution you have been searching for your entire life.

Kaynyne uses the latest in image recognition software to immediately and precisely identify any breed of dog that you come across. Just simply open the app, point your phone camera towards a dog of any kind, snap a picture of it, and within seconds you are able to peruse a vast selection of information tailored to that specific type of breed. Information includes things such as the dog’s breed, and major traits of said specie such as aggression, level of independence, playfulness, and compatibility with other dogs. Kaynyne will even access the databases of local animal shelters within your city and display if that type of dog is available for adoption.

We expect Kaynyne to be used in a large variety of scenarios, with many possible real world applications. A user may be an already experienced dog owner who possesses general knowledge of dog breeds, but would still benefit from the information provided by our app on the aggressiveness and playfulness of other dogs in the area. Veterinarians would find kaynyne useful as a quick access encyclopaedia to help speed up diagnosis and treatment processes. For our lowest level of users, users who have relatively no experience or knowledge about dog breeds or dogs in general, Kaynyne can aid them in finding the perfect breed suited to their lifestyle and even locate the nearest animal shelter where said breed may be found.

## Stakeholders and Users

| Stakeholders  | Direct User | Population | Background  Knowledge
| ------------- |:----:|:---------:| :-----
| Current Dog Owners |Yes| High | Experience taking care of dogs. Most likely is knowledgeable about select breeds of interest.
| Prospective Dog Owners |Yes| High | No experience taking care of dogs. Has little or no knowledge on dog breeds. 
| Dog Shelters/Pounds |No| Low | Very high experience of taking care of many breeds of dogs.  Large knowledge of most dog breeds.
| Experts | Yes/No | Low | Highly specialized knowledge about dogs on a professional level. Would use app mainly for recreation, or fact comparisons.

###Stakeholder Descriptions

A chart of the stakeholders for this project are above. It does not include the corporate structure of the application itself, but focuses rather on user impact. As the primary target demographic, existing or prospective dog owners will hold a larger population in the user base.  Although the knowledge of these two groups are clearly variable in practice, the typical assumption that dog owners will be more knowledgeable about dog breeds will be made for simplicity. As direct users of the app, the two groups are likewise stakeholders.

Dog shelters and pounds will also be impacted by the app due to a feature which shows users available locations of certain breeds, thereby increasing awareness. Experts in the field are also included, since professionals are likely to contribute or search facts on the app.

## User Research Methods

The three user research methods we decided on using were interviews, secondary research, and extreme interviews. Regular interviews are a great tool in gauging what a typical user of your platform would be like, how they would interact with your product and what they expect from you. They also help to establish a range of what kind of user spectrum you should expect. From the lowest end user, who may not have much experience with technology or the field in which your application revolves, to the higher end users who may be more technologically experienced and have prior knowledge about the field. During a face to face interview, the interviewer has control over the pace and the focus of the interview allowing them to keep the interviewee on track and focused on the product in question. During online surveys or questionnaires, the person taking the survey may become distracted by the environment around them causing them to lost their current train of thought leading to modified answers. 

We decided that secondary research would be of great benefit to us due to the fact that it allows us to scope out the current market, to see what we are competing with, and how to make our product better than the leading competitor. This sort of information is extremely valuable because, as a company, you are able to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of your competitors product when compared to your own allowing you to come up with solutions to problems you did not even know existed.

For our third research method, we decided to conduct an extreme interview to get a sense of what the highest level of a potential user might think of our product. We contacted a veterinarian clinic to see how they might use our system to help out with their daily routines. This type of interview allows us to gather user data while simultaneously exploring a potential revenue stream. If on the chance that a large client sees high potential in our product, they may be inclined to offer funding and partnership that would benefit both parties. 

### User Research Method 1: Interviews

Jeff Yip:

![](http://i.imgur.com/j6muZa6.jpg "Jeff and his dog Major")

1. Would you consider yourself a dog person?

    •	Jeff leads a busy lifestyle with his job which may require him to work overtime and weekends from time to time
    •	His schedule would directly impact the type of dog he gets, for example he would not opt to get a Husky because he is well versed in traits of dogs and knows that Huskies require a lot more attention compared to other breeds’
    •	Jeff already has a good sense of what kind of dog he’d be looking for due to his prior knowledge of different breeds and traits
 
5. How often do you interact with dogs that are not yours? Would you be interested in the ability to know a dog’s tendencies such as aggressiveness and playfulness prior to interacting with it?
    •	Jeff encounters many different dogs when he takes Major to the park, or for walks
    •	He is highly interested in the ability to instantly figure out if another person’s dog might be more on the aggressive side, mainly for the purpose of identifying whether allowing his dog to interact with them 

6. If you were to get a new dog, what would your primary method of acquiring it be? 
    •	Would ask around if friends knew anyone who was breeding dogs
    •	Admits that sometimes finding legitimate dog breeders is quite difficult, you can be scammed easily because it is very difficult to confirm that a dog is of the stated breed

### User Research Method 2: Secondary Research

![](http://i.imgur.com/xM8kelo.png "Information on breed from What-Dog")

https://www.what-dog.net/

What-Dog is an app created by Microsoft which is very similar to our app, kaynyne. They both use image recognition software to identify different dog breeds from images taken by your phone. Once the breed has been identified, the related information is displayed about the breed. The difference being that the information displayed by What-Dog is a very summarized and shortened snippet which does not fully explain all the traits and personality types of the different breeds. You are only shown a small portion of the information, while kaynyne will elaborate much more on the information given to show all possible facts about the breed in question.

Another difference is that What-Dog does not show you if the breed is available at your local shelter or not. If you come across a type of dog that you absolutely love, you are still not much closer to acquiring it because you don’t necessarily know where to find said dog. Kaynyne is tied into the databases of animal shelters across your city, providing real time information on where to find the type of dog you are searching for.

![](http://i.imgur.com/P91ELn7.png "Home screen of What-Dog")

Kaynyne functions much like snapchat in the sense that when you open kaynyne, the camera is immediately ready to take a picture of whatever your phone is facing, there are no in-between steps. When you open up What-Dog you are greeted with a menu of three different options and must click on the camera thumbnail to be able to take a picture of the dog you are currently looking at. This is a small discrepancy, yet it attributes to a large sense of disruption in the “flow” of the app. A user using kaynyne may be in a rush or does not have the time (dogs travel quickly and are unpredictable) to take a good picture and would highly appreciate the ability to immediately begin snapping pictures.


### User Research Method 3: Extreme Interview

![](http://i.imgur.com/UtJCGjp.jpg")
![](http://i.imgur.com/0LIx89c_d.jpg")
![](http://i.imgur.com/60baOzF_d.jpg")

I went to Calgary North Veterinary Hospital to interview a manager, Jay about the potential uses of Kaynyne in veterinary practice. Jay explained to me the basic treatment flow of the patients here - after being checked in, the client and patient go to a triage, are helped by a nurse, then are seen by a veterinarian for further consultation - much like visits to the family doctor.

Kaynyne would not be used on workers' personal smartphones, but rather on hospital owned equipment. Currently most hospital owned equipment are on an iOS platform - iPhones and iPads. There are a couple of Android phones for usage.

Jay also explained that there are already software solutions in place for dealing with their clients' personal information. He said that a feature for automatic data entry of the dog's picture or facial/body recognition data into the hospital's personal information file system would be useful.

Jay suggested the potential use of Kaynyne as a tracker for patients who come in with clients who are not the people listed on their management file. For example: if the daughter of a dog's owner comes in but has no ID, Kaynyne could be used for verification of the proper patient. A camera could be mounted near the front door about one foot high, with a designated picture taking spot.

I mentioned the potentially using Kaynyne to deliver information about particular breeds after taking a picture of them. Jay emphasized that such information would not be very useful to the hospital, but suggested that a tool for clients to find veterinarians would be better suited for a general non-expert userbase.

### Reflections on User Research

After the execution of all three different user research methods, we were pleased to see that our product has potential and that most of the data we gathered was positive. Out of all three methods, the face to face interviews of different users was deemed to be the most insightful due to the fact that we were able to gather data from potential users who would be on different ends of the spectrum when it came to dog knowledge and experience. 
Jeff, who has had a dog in his family since childhood, had a considerable amount of knowledge about the different dog breeds and their traits through life experiences. Even though Jeff was well educated on breeds, he still saw value in the ability to instantly know the specific details about other breeds of dogs he might encounter on his walks with Major. Jordan on the other hand did not have quite the level of knowledge when it came to different dog breeds, nor did he own a dog himself. Jordan would like to own a dog of his own someday but has specific requirements of the kind of behavioural traits he is looking for in a breed of dog. He instantly saw value in our product once he found out that our database would be linked to local animal shelters that can help him find the right dog for his lifestyle.
Secondary research allowed us to compare our competitor's platform against ours, and outline the advantages and disadvantages. We were able to gain a lot of valuable information about what kind of user experience we want to provide, and what we needed to do to set ourselves apart from our competitors.
Jay, the interviewee for our Extreme Interview was very helpful with insights into the potential uses for Kaynyne in a veterinarian and office setting. The primary focus for this user base would be for functionality in data entry for already existing software. There are little to no limitations on the user's cognition or ability to use the application.

## Task Descriptions

1. Bob is a 25-year-old man who has been thinking about owning a dog. He wants to use the Kaynyne app to browse through some recommendations. Bob quickly makes an account and looks through the database, before settling on German Shepherds. After tapping on the nearest available location, he is on his way.  He knows nothing about dogs, and has limited knowledge about technology.  He only uses popular apps like FaceBook, Tumblr, SnapChat and Instagram.  Bob usually uses his phone outdoors during his afternoon run.

2. Anne, a middle-aged mother of two, owns three dogs – two beagles and a poodle.  She has downloaded the app and wants to add her friends who are also dog owners.  She tries to add her two other friends, but mistakenly sends a request to someone else with a similar username.  She promptly deletes the request and resends.  She is usually busy either cooking dinner or caring for her dogs.  She considers herself both knowledgeable about dog breeds and technology.    

3. Mike is a 30 year old male who has just recently acquired a Golden Retriever from his colleague’s dog, who had a litter of puppies. Mike’s knowledge of dogs and different dog breeds is relatively average so he downloads kaynyne onto his phone and looks up all the information he can find about Golden Retrievers. Later in the day, he opens the app at the dog park while walking his puppy, taking pictures of the nearby dogs and analyzing their aggression and playfulness levels. Mike uses many apps like google maps, whatsapp and facebook on his phone throughout the day.

4. Catherine is a 19 year old female who owns two Huskies, and is very passionate and knowledgeable about anything and everything to do with dogs. She has made it her life’s mission to meet and interact with as many different dog breeds possible, as she aspires to one day become a professional dog trainer. During her runs out with her Huskies, she likes to take pictures of all the new dog breeds she encounters and adds them to her favourite’s list to study the information about them later on. Catherine constantly uses snapchat and instagram to take pictures of her Huskies and posts them regularly on facebook.

5. Alice is a secretary at a veterinarian office. A new client comes in with a dog in a kennel, and Alice is needed to greet the client and to import data into the patient information system. This includes: name, height, weight, a picture, and the client's personal information regarding insurance, name, address, contact information, and so on.
