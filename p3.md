## Highlight Walkthrough

The design of our Axure prototype has been kept basically the same as our paper prototype, adhering to the same specifications we created the first time and sticking to our design philosophies. We have decided to showcase our Credits feature which allows the user to accrue points when accomplishing certain tasks, a working Store feature which allows users to purchase coupons with their hard earned credits, and a fully fleshed out home screen which where our users will likely spend the most amount of time snapping pictures and navigating through Kaynyne.

Kaynyne does not require you to create any sort of new account or sign up, rather it uses your already existing facebook account to log in. This design choice was made for the benefit of the user, allowing them to seamlessly keep all their stored information and quickly find which of their facebook friends are also using Kaynyne! Integrating Kaynyne with facebook helps keep the experience more social, allowing the user to feel more connected with their friends and family while using Kaynyne.

The Store has been kept largely the same as it was when first envisioned during our paper prototype. We designed it to be as simple as possible, a constant feed of daily updated coupons provided by the market places and business owners selected to have their products displayed. A user would simply access the store through Kaynyne, scroll through the list of coupons provided, select their desired coupon, and if they have enough credits they are able to purchase said coupon.

All coupons are created with a 24 hour expiry limit and once the coupon has expired, it can no longer be used. This decision was made to entice the user to keep coming back to our app, creating a sense of urgency to always be scanning for new coupons and avoid missing any new and amazing deals!

Once the coupon has been purchased it is immediately transferred to the users Wallet which can be accessed at any time within Kaynyne, and the user is free to head to their nearest business location (business of which the coupon is valid for) and just display their coupon within the app to redeem it.

Another way to keep our users returning to Kaynyne is through our credit earning "points system". Users have many different ways to accrue credits such as registering their own personal dog within the app, or snapping a picture of a breed they have not yet taken a picture of with Kaynyne. There are several other ways a user may accrue points, such as visiting a local "dog park of the day" and checking in with Kaynyne to earn some points, but for the purpose of this demo we have only implemented the two ways thus far. 

Users may keep track of their "Funds" by accessing their in app Wallet where the current amount of credits are displayed. A user may venture to the in app Store and redeem their credits to purchase any coupon they desire, only if they have enough credits of course. Currently our users are only able to redeem credits for coupons for the purpose of this demo, but down the road they may be able to spend their hard earned credits on mini games within the app, or even Kaynyne merchandise such as special dog tags or apparel.

When Kaynyne is loaded up, the home screen puts our users immediately into the action by allowing them to begin snapping pictures right away. This design decision was made during the conduction of our Secondary Research when we found that our competitors had in between steps and screens which would slow down the process of taking pictures, because as we all know dogs won't just sit still all day and wait for you to take pictures of them. The design interface was heavily inspired by Snapchat, as we decided to keep the feel and flow of Kaynyne as smooth as possible.

The left "Star" button represents the Favourites tab, and within this tab a user is able to scroll through their list of favourite pictures they have taken thus far. Once a user snaps a picture of a dog, they are given the option of highlighting it as a favourite and writing down a quick little blurb about why they loved the picture so much and what the memory means to them.

The "Book" button to the right opens up the Friends tab. Users may add their friends through Kaynyne to keep up to date with their dogs, their current list of favourites, and their current status whichever that may be. For demonstration purposes the Friends tab only allows a user to view an example of what the tab would look like, incorporating a Picture for each friend, a name, and their current status.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

|No.| Name  | Heuristic Violated | Description | Suggested Fix | Severity Level |
|:-:| :-------------: |:----:|:---------:| :-----:|:-:|

After combining our individual heuristic evaluations, we have determined several major design flaws that need to be fixed.  It was initially difficult to find problems, but upon further inspection, multiple errors inevitably made themselves known. Following the numbering scheme of the table above, we will talk about violation 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13/15.
###Violation 7 – Rank 4
Violation 7 occurs primarily on the register dog fields, when the user can input their details. The problem here is the phone number and tag number fields. Currently, there are no active checks to ensure user inputs are properly formatted. This means, for example, that the user can input letters in place of their phone number. This is less of a user problem, and more of a major issue for the extensibility of the entire application.  

With how the application is supposed to work, these fields cannot be allowed to have erroneous values. Future functions which identify and/or use these fields would essentially crash whenever used. To avoid the need for a complete data overhaul later in the lifetime of the application, it would be preferable to apply extensive filters to ensure users are inputting truthful and valid information.  

This can take the form of simply applying formatting checks (checking if the type is correct, or if there are the right amount of numbers).  If the importance of these values are increased through additional features, it may be necessary to request user authentication from the user (calling the phone number verification for example).
###Violation 9 – Rank 4
This is a very large problem that will require much further insight.  Users can indefinitely register the same dog or the same breed of dog for infinite points. This is clearly a problem because this bug would make the entire points system obsolete. Loopholes and glitches like this are problematic to any rewards based interaction – the incentive to participate for all parties decreases. User are less likely to become invested due to cheaters, and stores are less likely to supply easily obtained discounts.

The difficult for this specific problem is technology.  The suggested fix is to simply create a cap for every breed or dog for each user.  But this is harder than it sounds. The recognition tool suddenly needs to be much more precise – able to discern a dog of the same breed from another dog of that breed.  Questions like “how would two similar looking dogs be distinguished”, or “what threshold value for two different dogs” arise. 

Another possible solution for this would be to limit point accrual per unit of time for every user. This will soften the impact of abusers, but it will also lower participant incentive slightly. 
###Violation 10 – Rank 2
As the table shows, this violation concerns the navigation of the app itself.  There is no way to reach other pages without returning to the home page (the central hub).  This is a quality of life issue, as experienced users who know where to go and what to do cannot navigate faster.  As this problem was not severe for the functionality of the app, it does pose significant annoyance to users.  

As a lower ranked issue, the suggested fix was to simply add a navigation pane, or some other secondary means of movement. This solution should not affect beginner users too much if properly executed (properly hidden, but accessible), and will greatly help seasoned users.
###Violation 11 – Rank 2
Icons do not accompany the text. This was initially planned in the development of the prototype, but spatial limitations of the tab conflicted. Under further considerations, many users would benefit from its implementation.  This is especially the case with visually impaired users which may have trouble reading just text. Icons are also known to increase overall productivity of experienced users – there is no need to spend time reading labels when memorable icons are available. Children, though to a limited extent, may also be able to more easily comprehend the actual functionality of each page.

The suggested, and highly recommended fix is to indeed add these icons to the left or right to the text.  These points alone might be enough to warrant a graphical overhaul of the entire “plus tabs” design, where perhaps the icons themselves would become the focus point of the user.  
###Violation 13/15 – Rank 3 
This violation was subject to much debate throughout the group concerning the severity of the issue. There is currently no active tutorial that guides users on the features and functionality of the app. Depending on the user, this issue can have vastly varied effects. Experienced users to other similar apps like snapchat or Instagram will have a lower learning curve, while beginner users might have a bit more trouble becoming acquainted with the system.  

A suggestion for this was to insert a quick little animated/interactive tutorial when viewing a page for the first time.  In addition to this, a “help” section can be implemented where users can browse commonly asked questions, or perhaps request technical support. Users that do have experience have the option to simply skip the tutorial.
