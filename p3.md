## Highlight Walkthrough

The design of our Axure prototype has been kept basically the same as our paper prototype, adhering to the same specifications we created the first time and sticking to our design philosophies. We have decided to showcase our Credits feature which allows the user to accrue points when accomplishing certain tasks, a working Store feature which allows users to purchase coupons with their hard earned credits, and a fully fleshed out home screen which where our users will likely spend the most amount of time snapping pictures and navigating through Kaynyne.

Kaynyne does not require you to create any sort of new account or sign up, rather it uses your already existing facebook account to log in. This design choice was made for the benefit of the user, allowing them to seamlessly keep all their stored information and quickly find which of their facebook friends are also using Kaynyne! Integrating Kaynyne with facebook helps keep the experience more social, allowing the user to feel more connected with their friends and family while using Kaynyne.

The Store has been kept largely the same as it was when first envisioned during our paper prototype. We designed it to be as simple as possible, a constant feed of daily updated coupons provided by the market places and business owners selected to have their products displayed. A user would simply access the store through Kaynyne, scroll through the list of coupons provided, select their desired coupon, and if they have enough credits they are able to purchase said coupon.

All coupons are created with a 24 hour expiry limit and once the coupon has expired, it can no longer be used. This decision was made to entice the user to keep coming back to our app, creating a sense of urgency to always be scanning for new coupons and avoid missing any new and amazing deals!

Once the coupon has been purchased it is immediately transferred to the users Wallet which can be accessed at any time within Kaynyne, and the user is free to head to their nearest business location (business of which the coupon is valid for) and just display their coupon within the app to redeem it.

Another way to keep our users returning to Kaynyne is through our credit earning "points system". Users have many different ways to accrue credits such as registering their own personal dog within the app, or snapping a picture of a breed they have not yet taken a picture of with Kaynyne. There are several other ways a user may accrue points, such as visiting a local "dog park of the day" and checking in with Kaynyne to earn some points, but for the purpose of this demo we have only implemented the two ways thus far. 

Users may keep track of their "Funds" by accessing their in app Wallet where the current amount of credits are displayed. A user may venture to the in app Store and redeem their credits to purchase any coupon they desire, only if they have enough credits of course. Currently our users are only able to redeem credits for coupons for the purpose of this demo, but down the road they may be able to spend their hard earned credits on mini games within the app, or even Kaynyne merchandise such as special dog tags or apparel.

When Kaynyne is loaded up, the home screen puts our users immediately into the action by allowing them to begin snapping pictures right away. This design decision was made during the conduction of our Secondary Research when we found that our competitors had in between steps and screens which would slow down the process of taking pictures, because as we all know dogs won't just sit still all day and wait for you to take pictures of them. The design interface was heavily inspired by Snapchat, as we decided to keep the feel and flow of Kaynyne as smooth as possible.

The left "Star" button represents the Favourites tab, and within this tab a user is able to scroll through their list of favourite pictures they have taken thus far. Once a user snaps a picture of a dog, they are given the option of highlighting it as a favourite and writing down a quick little blurb about why they loved the picture so much and what the memory means to them.

The "Book" button to the right opens up the Friends tab. Users may add their friends through Kaynyne to keep up to date with their dogs, their current list of favourites, and their current status whichever that may be. For demonstration purposes the Friends tab only allows a user to view an example of what the tab would look like, incorporating a Picture for each friend, a name, and their current status.

| Name  | Heuristic Violated | Description | Suggested Fix | Severity Level
| ------------- |:----:|:---------:| :-----:|:-:|
| Brandon Sieu |Visibility of System Status| “Coupon purchased” prompt does not inform user that the coupon is available in the wallet | Add the additional line | 1
| Brandon Sieu |Match Between System and the Real World| Friend icon is a book, which may not be very representative of actual contents | Replace with a commonly used “friends” symbol in other social media | 1
| Valerie Kim |Consistency and Standards| Friends and Register Dog<br/>Different text fonts used in this application for card-headers and small text. | Choose a font to consistently use for all text in the application. | 1
| Alex | Consistency and Standards | The Register Dog tab utilizes boxed image tabs for the dog photos, while the rest of the pages use more circular image style. | Change image styles to one type throughout the app, preferably circular pictures. | 1
| Alex/Valerie Kim| Consistency and Standards | Some pages show the current “Funds” for the user while others do not. | Make a button that is available on every page that, when clicked, shows current funds/friends online/messages etc. | 1
| Alex| Consistency and Standards | Register Dog Tab error message shown is completely different from all the other pop up messages that occur throughout the app. | Redesign the message so that it conforms to the rest of the app.| 2
| Brandon Sieu| Error Prevention | No active input checks for register dog fields (allows anything) | Allow only a certain length and input type, possibly | 4
| Valerie Kim| Error Prevention | Register Dog<br/>The labels next to the text fields do not indicate that all fields are mandatory. | Add apostrophes to the labels, and add a visible label that states that fields with apostrophes are mandatory.| 1
| Alex| Error Prevention | A user can register the same dog or take a picture of the same breed over and over and accrue credits infinitely. | Create a cap that recognizes when a unique breed or dog has been registered, blocking malicious misuse of the funds functionality. | 4
| Brandon Sieu/Valerie Kim| Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | No way for experienced users to jump between different tabs faster other than going back to home | Implement an additional navigation bar, or pull down bar with links to other pages | 2
| Valerie Kim| Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design | Drop Down Menu<br/>The drop down menu does not have icons accompanying the text.|Add icons representing each menu option to the left or right of the menu option.| 2
| Brandon Sieu| Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover From Errors | When a user makes a purchase, the popup bubble does not provide useful information on how to accrue points | Add a link in the bubble that redirects to an informative page | 1
| Brandon Sieu| Help and Documentation | There is no active tutorial or help button to aid confused users| Add an additional tab on the “more” bar (plus sign drop down) called “help” | 2
| Valerie Kim| Help and Documentation | Wallet<br/>An empty wallet has no indication that you need to purchase coupons to use them.| Add a half-transparent label “buy a coupon to place it here!” below the header. | 2
| Alex| Help and Documentation | The home page of the app is quite basic but relies on the fact that our users have previous experience with apps such as snap chat or Instagram.| Provide an “info” or “guide” button with a few helpful tips about how to fully use the app. | 3
