The above is the storyboard. It depicts the general workflow and objectives of a user purchasing a coupon using the in-app currency system. Points are awarded for completing certain activities (similar to achievements). The in-app store catelogs a large assortment of pet-related coupons with participating stores. The store cycles coupons daily on rotation. A coupon will display additional information when tapped, and when purchased, will appear in the user's inventory to be redeemed.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

As a group, we sat down and began to discuss the various possible features (however boring or crazy) that could be implemented into Kaynyne. During the course of the discussion, whenever a member felt that there was a certain idea with some level of promise, they would begin to sketch out the possible implementation and extract the idea out of their thoughts. 

Some of the ideas were quite ludicrous (like the feature to be able to translate what a dog is saying to you in english...) but what we realized was that, no matter how crazy the idea, there was always some sort of underlying potential waiting to be refined, after dialling it down of course. 

We quickly ended up with multiple sketches and various ideas, realizing just how effective the process really is. The features ranged from very practical, such as an interface and method of how to add friends to your profile by simply tapping two phones together, to down right insane involving satellites scanning dogs in your surrounding areas and instantly identifying their breeds. 

# Affinity Diagram

Once we finished producing twelve sketches, we began the process of coming up with a few categories which we could use to group together all of our creations in a way that would make sense. We decided upon four different categories, Social, Rewards, Emergency, and Information.

The Social category was used to group together all the ideas which involved the user interacting with other users in any sort of way. These features included an events calendar which would allow organizations to create and promote events such as dog shows with relative ease, and a sketch design of what the friends tab interface might look like for a user.

The Rewards category was used to group together all the ideas which involved ways for the user to be rewarded by using Kaynyne. These features included a built in daily coupon book with coupons provided by local pet shops/groomers/veterinarians, and a system which rewarded users with points whenever they achieved a certain task such as discovering a new breed of dog that they have yet to snap a picture of.

The Emergency category encompassed ideas which involved anything to do with the well being of a users dog. These included features such as a lost dog finder which allows the user to report their dog as missing, instantly warning all users within the local city to be on the lookout for the missing dog providing photos and all relevant information, and a "Dog-MD" feature which would allow you to take a picture of your sick dog and have our software analyse a potential diagnosis and treatment plan (if a local vet was unreachable due to circumstances).

The last category was the Information category which contained all the ideas that involved ways of allowing the user to access relevant dog information. This information would include things like a dog park locator which would contain all necessary information for each local dog park such as leash/off-leash capabilities, a map of the park, and distance to the park. Another sketch grouped into the Information category was a rough mark up of what the breed "information tab" would look like after a user takes a picture of a dog to find out it's breed, what kind of lay out it would have and roughly how it would function.

We discovered that, while completing the process of the affinity diagram, we were already discussing and thinking about which ideas were deemed as "really good" and which ideas were deemed as "back to the drawing board". This was happening because we were forced to critically think about every single sketch and what it's underlying potential was. Once the affinity diagram was completed, we narrowed down all our wacky sketches to just three, the "Missing Dog" feature, the "Coupon Book" feature, and the "Points Rewards" system. 



## Reflection

The entire ideation process went more or less smoothly, though that is not to say it was flawless. The team excelled at giving creative ideas and carried out work in a succinct, concise manner. All ideas were considered and welcomed - no baseless criticism whatsoever took place during the brainstorming phase. A strong work ethic was brought to meetings, along with prepared work.

There were definitely occasional lapses of communication between the five major tasks given. The distribution of work was also questionable due to the lack of a strong governing figure within the team. In addition to this, the strict time constraints understandably had an averse effect on project quality.

Things that could be done better on the next iteration would be time management and control. Scheduled times for work need to be adhered to, and work must be done with acceptable quality. Commitments should be taken with utmost dedication, if not for fear of repercussions, then at the very least for common decency.
