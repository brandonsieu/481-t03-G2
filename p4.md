# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

#Design Problem
Our primary design problem: ‘Design a phone application that uses dog analysis technology, to provide information about dogs to a general public.” After deliberation by the design team after research and brainstorming session, our design is focused on maintaining user retention through the app’s social functionality.

#User Research and Findings
We used three IDEO methods: an interview with two potential users, secondary research on a competitor’s application, and an extreme interview with a Veterinary Hospital manager. Our findings during this research influenced our direction to focus on social functionality.

Based on our 2 interviewees responses, we understand that prospective and current dog owners have very different needs and motivations for using Kaynyne. Users with little knowledge of dogs are interested but lack resources and motivation. Users with greater knowledge of dogs are not very interested in learning of other dogs.

Our secondary research found similar applications too tedious. The design team ran tasks through What Dog by Microsoft, but found themselves frustrated with the user experience. This personal experience allowed them to understand the necessity for simplicity and speed, given the difficulty of taking pictures of moving dogs.

#Design and Justification
Brainstorming designs and narrowing down from it, we came to a consensus on several features aimed at creating a more social experience. The application’s home page is based on Snapchat’s interface. Additionally, we emerged with our points and coupons system, which is featured prominently in our prototypes. Coupons are rotated frequently to encourage users to come back to see new coupons.

#Heuristic Evaluation and Findings
After quickly prototyping on Axure, we ran an individual then collaborative heuristics evaluation (Jakob Nielsen’s 10 heuristics). Our results show that we need to deal with particular violations immediately, such as the ability to gain infinite points, or the lack of a help system for users. 

#Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design
A common thread througout our heuristic violations is the failure to design for a user with less motor capacity or attention. The solutions for these are straightforward, such as implementing industry standards on error checking or text field validity.

## Design Problem

Kaynyne was initially designed to tackle the problem of a lack of education when it came to dog breeds, their traits, and where to find breeds you're looking for at your local shelters. Throughout the design process, we found that Kaynyne was better suited to be a more social based application allowing users to stay connected with each other and provide them with fun activities that they can do with their dogs, as well as identifying and education about different dog breeds. In the end, the design problem we needed to address was "how can we provide education and fact checking, while retaining and reaching a wide user base regardless of their dog knowledge or ownership?". This problem was addressed through extensive user research, design innovation and deliberation as a team, and the creation of multiple prototypes allowing us to demonstrate our technology.  

## User Research and Findings

During our user research we implemented three different methods to acquire our findings. We interviewed two users of differing dog knowledge, carried out secondary research by using and analysing a competitor application called What Dog developed by Microsoft, and conducted an extreme interview with a Veterinary Hospital manager.

From the two interviews, we learned two things. The first thing was that, users whom already had some concrete knowledge about different dog breeds and currently own a dog, would struggle to find a reason as to why they would use Kaynyne on a regular basis. On the other hand, users which had relatively little or no knowledge about dogs in general were quite interested in the ability to learn about dog breeds. Their interest levels were even higher if they were looking to one day own a dog of their own, interested in being able to look for a dog breed which would best suit their lifestyle and being able to locate that special dog at their nearest shelter through Kaynyne. The second thing that we learned was that we needed a way to keep ALL of our users coming back, regardless of their dog knowledge. We needed to come up with a system which would allow us to retain our users, and not just be a one time use application.  

We conducted secondary research on an already existing application called What Dog, developed by Microsoft, and analysed what kind of products we may be competing with. We learned that while the product was quite impressive, it did have some design choices which we considered to be flaws. One design choice in particular was the fact that when a user opens What Dog, they are greeted with a home page containing a menu to select where to go next. Therefore, if a user wanted to take a picture of a dog in front of them, they would open the app, wait for it to load, select the camera function, the function would then pull up another window for the camera and finally be able to take a picture. This whole process took a lot of time (relatively speaking), and we found that even just trying to take a picture of a dog could be more difficult than expected due to the fact that dogs tend to run around and not stay very still.

From our extreme interview, with a veterinary hospital manager, we learned that Kaynyne would not be able to penetrate that market as easily as we previously thought. Vet hospitals already had software and methods in place that were not tailored to a general public, like Kaynyne is, but more towards the experts with vast amounts of knowledge when it comes to dog breeds and how to treat them properly. We realized that this made a lot of sense, and ultimately this realization was the turning point to making Kaynyne a more social and casual based application.   

## Design and Justification

Through our user research findings we realized that, other than just taking pictures of dogs and getting breed information, we needed to offer something more to users to interest them into joining Kaynyne regardless of their dog knowledge. From here we turned towards creating a more social experience and, by integrating a required facebook log in, we would be able to pull the users current facebook friends and show them who else is using Kaynyne and allow them to connect with each other. This decision was made due to the fact that, if your friends and family are doing something, you are much more likely to join them and want to keep connected with them.

After conducting secondary research by using What Dog, we realized that we needed to make Kaynyne quicker and more agile as an application to be able to set ourselves apart. We decided to adopt a snapchat inspired design for our home screen, which would instantly load you into the camera feature upon opening Kaynyne. This decision allowed the user to save precious time when wanting to take that perfect photo of a dog for themselves or to find out it's breed, because every second counts when you're trying to take a picture of something as unpredictable as a dog can be.

Once we found out how difficult it might be to penetrate the Veterinary market, through our extreme interview, we decided to look towards other markets and methods of monetization. This is where the store and point rewards system came into play allowing us to both, create a way for monetization and a system which would greatly help us retain our user base. We took inspiration from systems like Xbox Live which gave users points for certain "achievements" they would accomplish within their games, allowing the user to spend these points on cosmetic features for their account. Kaynyne rewards users with "credits" every time they, take a picture of a breed they have not seen before, register their own dog into our system, refer friends through facebook to join kaynyne, daily check-ins at local dog parks (much like Pokemon Go), and weekly events/challenges such as walking your dog a certain distance. These points would then be spent on our in app store allowing the user to purchase coupons for all dog related things such as, grooming, toys, food, and activities. The coupons are set to expire after 24 hours, and new coupons are added to the store daily keeping users interested and scouring for new great deals all the time.   

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

During the heuristic evaluations stage, developers take a critical perspective on product design  based on, in this case, Jakob Nielsen’s ten heuristic violations.  This task was completed in two parts: individual, then collaborative. After the individual phase, a combined, comprehensive list was created which included major design flaws and their respective severity ratings. 

The results of this evaluation showed several major violations. The most prominent of the categories being error prevention and help/documentation. For clarity’s sake, only the three most severe violations are below.

###Severity 4, Error Prevention
In regards to error prevention, an error was found that the user could infinitely earn points when taking a picture of the same dog/breed. This proved catastrophic for the integrity of the entire reward-based system – abusers, cheaters or hackers almost always deter actual participants. A simple fix to this small error could be to check for the uniqueness of the dog or breed in question. Or more easily programmed, a “points cap” could be implemented to limit the amount of daily points attainable, which would also encourage users to return.

###Severity 4, Error Prevention
Another less notable, but similarly as abusable error was the fact that no error checking was being done on user inputs. A user can enter erroneous inputs for their phone number or dog tag number in the register dog page. Although at the current stage, this would not affect the application as profoundly, planned features in the future would essentially break if the fields are left unmonitored. The industry-wide fix to this common problem would be to simply implement an input filter which restricts user input to supported types.

###Severity 3, Help and Documentation
After implementing the entire prototype, the group had missed one crucial element of user design. The user is not a genius or a developer, but a normal person. There is no active in-app tutorial or even a help page available for the entire application. Users are simply assumed to have either fast learning curves or previous experience with similar apps. This is especially a design blunder since the target demographic is composed of many users who are not technologically savvy.  An unanimously required fix would be to implement a fun, instructive tutorial before every feature which can be skipped by the more experienced users.  In conjunction with this, insert a help center in the main menu tab with a wealth of information.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

A prevalent element of the current design became apparent – the user is given too much freedom and power. Many of these violations have emerged due to an ill-placed trust in the user to not attempt to break the system, or to be familiar with how programs work. 

Moving forward into other iterations, it would be imperative to remember who our users are. Ultimately, the application should be easily picked up even by a novice of technology, yet expressive enough so that experienced users are not held back. Additional constraints can be implemented to guide user interaction, and much more help text would prove instrumental to making the app accessible to everyone. This can be extended to children as well – if the design is more amiable and fun, users of a younger age are more likely to have a good user experience. In general, the interface could be refined, refurbished and moulded to accept the actual user demographic.

Following this mentality, experienced users can look forward to continuous updates containing ease of navigation, heightened connectivity and new functionalities. Allowing users to navigate swiftly through the interface without the use of the home button is a high priority. Likewise, we would like to expand the rewards based system and increase social connectivity of users. Plans of implementing a lost dog feature, integrating park hotspots with the rewards-based system and nearby dog events are also in the works. 

Finally, frequent checks for damaging errors and error prevention is pivotal to application success and good design. Implementing input check filters, conducting thorough tests and fixing abusive bugs are immediate goals for the future. Instead of periodic evaluations, a modular test flow can be implemented, where functionalities are tested whenever changes are made to the system. Ideally, automated testing can be used as well, which would decreased wasted resources.

## Conclusions

Throughout the entire design process, Kaynyne went through many changes and innovations to adapt to the requirements of our user base. The idea of Kaynyne at the beginning was to educate users on different dog breeds, their characteristics and traits. After extensive user research, the user demographic for the application became more tangible and sophisticated. By addressing the user’s needs and wants, Kaynyne grew to include large objectives such as a rewards system, social media connectivity and powerful breed recognition. The heuristic evaluations performed well to keep the project design on track, exposing the frailties of the system while also opening new opportunities for development. As a team, we brainstormed and illustrated many different feature ideas, and produced two different prototypes in order to achieve our final design. The prototypes allowed us to flesh out our design ideas and learn about what good and efficient design actually means.
